# Background
## Why did I build the app?
During The Great Lockdown of 2020, I was able to save more money
whilst working from home. I found myself constantly using [this savings
calculator](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/savings-calculator)
on The Money Advice Service website. It's a very basic tool which I wanted
to make a native app for. I wanted to utilize my newly found skills in
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) in anyway possible.
